# About Me

Hi! I’m **Sama**, AKA 0xSky — a cybersecurity student, aspiring penetration tester, and someone who's in deep love with anything tech-related

I mainly focus on:

- **Cybersecurity & CTFs** — especially Web, OSINT, and Forensics
- **Pentesting basics** and mastering security principles
- **Programming** — mostly Python for scripts and experiments

I really enjoy documenting what I learn, which is why I started this blog — to share:

- CTF write-ups
- Cybersecurity notes
- Clear explanations and corrections of common misconceptions
- Random tech thoughts and experiments

Thanks for passing by — I hope you find something useful, fun, or inspiring here!  
Feel free to reach out anytime :)
